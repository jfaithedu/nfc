# BlueALSA Integration - New Approach

> **IMPORTANT: NEW IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**
>
> The previous approach to BlueALSA integration by compiling `bluez-alsa` from source has been abandoned. This document outlines the new approach using standard Raspberry Pi OS packages.

## Key Changes in Implementation Strategy

1. **Simplified Packaging**:
   - Use `bluealsa` package from Raspberry Pi OS repositories
   - Avoid source compilation entirely
   - Use standard system services

2. **Single Audio Stack**:
   - Use BlueALSA as the primary Bluetooth audio provider
   - Remove PulseAudio to prevent conflicts
   - Direct ALSA to BlueALSA routing for simplicity

3. **Streamlined Configuration**:
   - Standard systemd service approach
   - Minimal command-line options
   - Proper integration with Raspberry Pi's audio system

## Package Information

| Aspect | Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Package name | `bluez-alsa` (compiled) | `bluealsa` (repository) |
| Daemon name | `bluealsad` | `bluealsa` |
| System service | `bluealsad.service` | `bluealsa.service` |
| Binary path | `/usr/local/bin/bluealsad` | `/usr/bin/bluealsa` |

## Installation

### Standard Installation

```bash
# Update repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Add Raspberry Pi repository if not on Raspberry Pi OS
if ! grep -q "raspbian" /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*; then
  echo "Adding Raspberry Pi repository..."
  echo "deb http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list
  wget -qO - https://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/raspberrypi.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get update
fi

# Install the bluealsa package
sudo apt-get install -y bluealsa

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable bluealsa
sudo systemctl start bluealsa
```

### Service Configuration

If the service doesn't start correctly, create a custom service file:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/systemd/system/bluealsa.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=BlueALSA service
After=bluetooth.service
Requires=bluetooth.service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bluealsa -p a2dp-sink -p a2dp-source
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluealsa
```

## Testing the Setup

After installation, verify the setup:

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status bluealsa

# List available Bluetooth audio devices
bluealsa-aplay -l

# Play audio through a connected Bluetooth device
bluealsa-aplay -v [MAC_ADDRESS] /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

## Development Integration

When integrating with Python:

```python
import subprocess
import dbus

# Check BlueALSA status
def check_bluealsa_status():
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["systemctl", "is-active", "bluealsa"], 
            capture_output=True, 
            text=True
        )
        return result.stdout.strip() == "active"
    except Exception:
        return False

# Play through BlueALSA
def play_through_bluealsa(device_mac, audio_file):
    try:
        subprocess.run(
            ["bluealsa-aplay", device_mac, audio_file],
            check=True
        )
        return True
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        return False
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Service Not Starting

If the BlueALSA service doesn't start:

```bash
# Check the status
systemctl status bluealsa

# Check logs
journalctl -u bluealsa

# Try reinstalling
sudo apt-get purge bluealsa
sudo apt-get install -y bluealsa
```

### Connection Issues

If Bluetooth devices won't connect:

```bash
# Make sure Bluetooth is powered on
bluetoothctl power on

# Reset the controller
sudo bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# power off
[bluetooth]# power on
[bluetooth]# exit

# Check if BlueALSA is configured for audio profiles
ps aux | grep bluealsa
```

### Audio Playback Problems

If audio won't play:

```bash
# Check available audio devices
bluealsa-aplay -l

# Check if device is connected in audio profile
bluetoothctl info [MAC_ADDRESS] | grep "Audio Sink"

# Try direct ALSA playback
aplay -D bluealsa:DEV=[MAC_ADDRESS],PROFILE=a2dp /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```
